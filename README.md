# Floris' Portfolio Application

## About this project

I will be developing a portfolio application, which will showcase my skills in the form of applications that I have created. The portfolio application itself will be a culmination of my skills that I have acquired throughout my studies. Even though having a full-stack application to display 'static' applications is a bit of an overkill, I like the challenge of creating an application from scratch. The application owner will be able to add new projects for display through an admin panel - the project information will be saved in the database. Visitors to the site will be able to see projects I've worked on with a link to GitHub, list of technologies used, project description and more.

This application will be as generic as possible, so that other people may clone it and host it themselves.

This application will feature:

- ReactJS front-end
- NodeJS back-end with GraphQL Yoga
- GraphQL as database query language
- Complete CI/CD pipeline with CircleCI, Heroku and CodeClimate for test coverage
- Extensive unit testing and integration testing
- Authentication with JWT

## How to use

This section will be implemented at a later date, when I'm close to finishing the application.
